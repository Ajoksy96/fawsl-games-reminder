# FAWSL Games Reminder
A Python program to automate putting FA Women's Super League soccer games on my Google Calendar.

I scraped data about each 2023-2024 FA WSL game from https://womenscompetitions.thefa.com/Fixtures-Results. I then parsed and cleaned these data and connected to the Google Calendar API to automatically include each game on my calendar. I also put the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.
